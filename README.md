# Group Affect Prediction Using Mulimodal Distributions

This is the repository containing Keras code for emotion detection of a group. This repository has Jupyter notebooks for creating various heatmaps, the two convolutional neural networks used in the paper. Data is assumed to be in the `Data` directory. The data couldn't be shared since we don't have permission to freely distribute the dataset. 

The notebook `Demo.ipynb` has been obtained from the webpage for [Emotion Recognition in the Wild via Convolutional Neural Networks and Mapped Binary Patterns](https://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/projects/cnn_emotions/)

Weights for the models can be downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ihe0fmcwmc70va2/AAAo_ES3NECvWSu5GSbScMyka?dl=0).
